My Social Engineering Project
Student: ABIR SIDDIQ 
Course: BCSS VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS  
Date: January 2026  

 Project Overview
This repository contains detailed writeups for two social engineering exercises completed as part of my security education. Both exercises were conducted in a controlled, educational environment following ethical guidelines.

 Exercise Writeups
1. [Exercise 1: Phishing Email Analysis] - https://github.com/Abbie1750/social-engineering---lab/blob/main/exercise%201%20phishing%20analysis.md
    Analysis of phishing tactics and defense strategies
2. [Exercise 2: OSINT Information Gathering] - https://github.com/Abbie1750/social-engineering---lab/blob/main/exercise%202%20osint
    Open source intelligence collection methodology

 Learning Objectives
- Understand social engineering attack vectors
- Develop analytical skills for security threats
- Create comprehensive security documentation
- Apply ethical principles to security testing

 Ethical Statement
All exercises were conducted in a controlled environment with no real targets or unauthorized access. These writeups are for educational purposes only to demonstrate defensive security knowledge.
 Tools & Methods
- Documentation: GitHub Markdown
- Analysis: Manual examination
- Research: Open source materials
