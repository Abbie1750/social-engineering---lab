 My First Social Engineering Exercise

What I Did:
I learned about phishing emails (fake emails that trick people).

What I Found:
1. Fake emails look real but have small mistakes
2. They make you feel scared or excited
3. They want you to click bad links

 What I Learned:
Never click links in emails from strangers.
Always check the sender's email address.

 Screenshots:
I took pictures to show what I found.
