 My Second Social Engineering Exercise

 What I Did:
I learned about finding public information online (OSINT).

 What I Found:
1. People share too much information online
2. You can find addresses, jobs, and friends online
3. Attackers use this information to trick people

 Example:
If I know where you work and who your boss is...
I can send you a fake email from your boss!

 What I Learned:
Be careful what you share online.
Use privacy settings on Facebook and other sites.

 Screenshots:
I took pictures of my research.
